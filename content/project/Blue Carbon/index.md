The sequestration of "blue carbon" by seagrass meadows is a significant ecosystem service offered by these coastal primary producers. However, current blue carbon policy frameworks cannot incorporate this sequestration (Hejnowicz et al., 2015). This disconnect is caused by uncertainties and the cutting edge nature of seagrass blue carbon research. For example, nearly half of the carbon sequestered in seagrass meadows is actually from allochthonous sources rather than in-situ production (Kennedy et al., 2010). This makes it difficult to demonstrate that seagrass meadows are the cause for such sequestration and simply not "in the right place at the right time". Furthermore, the long term fate of sequestered carbon is not known. Studies suggest that "sequestered" carbon may actually be remineralizable despite implied recalcitrance (Macreadie et al., 2019b). If carbon is not actually permanently sequestered, there is little incentive to bolster cultivation of the field. Therefore, there are critical gaps in scientific knowledge that must be addressed.

As a field, researchers developed 10 major questions that are expected to lead the future of blue carbon science (Macreadie et al., 2019a). They identified "What is the global extent and temporal distribution of blue carbon ecosystems?" as a critical question for contemporary researchers because of the underlying lack of basic knowledge about these systems. Therefore, baseline estimates of seagrass blue carbon sequestration are needed for under-
studied systems. Despite being a hub of society, industrial, and scientific knowledge, the Gulf of Mexico remains understudied. Initial estimates have dubbed it a "blue carbon hotspot" because of its lush seagrasses, mangroves, and marsh ecosystems (Thorhaug et al., 2019). However, these baseline estimates lack incorporation of spatial heterogeneity associated with seagrass meadows. Ricart et al. (2020) found that seagrasses meadows can be
a stronger carbon sink (50-fold) just as a function from distance to estuary head. Without proper estimates of seagrass variability, there is large uncertainty in measurements. Therefore, finer scale measurements are needed.
