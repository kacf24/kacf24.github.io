The intertidal zone often has varying levels of environmental stresses (desiccation, temperature, light) that result in highly stress-tolerant macrobiota occupying the upper zone while less tolerant species occupy the lower zone, but little comparative information is available for intertidal bacteria. Here we describe natural (unmanipulated) bacterial communities of three Fucus congeners (F. spiralis, high zone; F. vesiculosus, mid zone; F. distichus, low zone) as well as those of F. vesiculosus transplanted to the high zone (Dry and Watered treatments) and to the mid zone (Procedural Control) during summer in Maine (United States). We predicted that bacterial communities would be different among the differently zoned natural congeners, and that higher levels of desiccation stress in the high zone would cause bacterial communities of Dry transplants to become similar to F. spiralis, whereas relieving desiccation stress on Watered transplants would maintain the mid-zone F. vesiculosus bacterial community. Bacteria were identified as amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) after sequencing the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Microbiome composition and structure were significantly different between the differently zoned congeners at each tissue type (holdfasts, receptacles, vegetative tips). ASVs significantly associated with the mid-zone congener were frequently also present on the high-zone or low-zone congener, whereas overlap in ASVs between the high-zone and low-zone congeners was rare. Only 7 of 6,320 total ASVs were shared among tissues over all congeners and transplant treatments. Holdfast bacterial community composition of Dry transplants was not significantly different from that of F. spiralis, but Watered holdfast communities were significantly different from those of F. spiralis and not significantly different from those of procedural controls. Additional stressor(s) appeared important, because bacterial communities of Dry and Watered transplants were only marginally different from each other (p = 0.059). The relative abundance of Rhodobacteraceae associated with holdfasts generally correlated with environmental stress with highest abundance associated with F. spiralis and the two high-zone transplant treatments. These findings suggest that the abiotic stressors that shape distributional patterns of host species also affect their bacterial communities.

Latitudinal diversity gradients have provided many insights into species differentiation and community processes. In the well-studied intertidal zone, however, little is known about latitudinal diversity in microbiomes associated with habitat-forming hosts. We investigated microbiomes of Fucus vesiculosus because of deep understanding of this model system and its latitudinally large, cross-Atlantic range. Given multiple effects of photoperiod, we predicted that cross-Atlantic microbiomes of the Fucus microbiome would be similar at similar latitudes and correlate with environmental factors. We found that community structure and individual amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) showed distinctive latitudinal distributions, but alpha diversity did not. Latitudinal differentiation was mostly driven by ASVs that were more abundant in cold temperate to subarctic (e.g., Granulosicoccus_t3260, Burkholderia/Caballeronia/Paraburkholderia_t8371) or warm temperate (Pleurocapsa_t10392) latitudes. Their latitudinal distributions correlated with different humidity, tidal heights, and air/sea temperatures, but rarely with irradiance or photoperiod. Many ASVs in potentially symbiotic genera displayed novel phylogenetic biodiversity with differential distributions among tissues and regions, including closely related ASVs with differing north-south distributions that correlated with Fucus phylogeography. An apparent southern range contraction of F. vesiculosus in the NW Atlantic on the North Carolina coast mimics that recently observed in the NE Atlantic. We suggest cross-Atlantic microbial structure of F. vesiculosus is related to a combination of past (glacial-cycle) and contemporary environmental drivers.
