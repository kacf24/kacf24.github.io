  Australia, Ltd Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing development
  and continuation of sustainable aquaculture in temperate regions. We primarily consider
  the ecological and physical resilience of aquaculture in the Gulf of Maine (GoM),
  where a thriving industry includes marine algae, extensive and intensive shellfish
  aquaculture, and a well-established Atlantic salmon industry, as well as the infrastructure
  required to support these economically important ventures. The historical record
  of sea surface temperature in the GoM, estimated from gridded, interpolated in situ
  measurements, shows considerable interannual and decade-scale variability superimposed
  on an overall warming trend. Climate model projections of sea surface temperature
  indicate that the surface waters in the GoM could warm 0.5–3.5°C beyond recent values
  by the year 2100. This suggests that, while variability will continue, anomalous
  warmth of marine heatwaves that have been observed in the past decade could become
  the norm in the GoM ca. 2050, but with the most significant impacts to existing
  aquaculture along the southernmost region of the coast. We consider adaptations
  leading to aquacultural resilience despite the effects of warming, larger numbers
  of harmful nonindigenous species (including pathogens and parasites), acidification,
  sea-level rise, and more frequent storms and storm surges. Some new species will
  be needed, but immediate attention to adapt existing species (e.g. preserve/define
  wild biodiversity, breed for temperature tolerance and incorporate greater husbandry)
  and aquaculture infrastructure can be successful. We predict that these measures
  and continued collaboration between industry, stakeholders, government and researchers
  will lead to sustaining a vibrant working waterfront in the GoM.
