abstract: © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019. A non-indigenous alga,
  Grateloupia turuturu (Halymeniales, Rhodophyta), was discovered in the Damariscotta
  Estuary (Maine, USA) in 2017, over 200 km north of its last reported location. Because
  of the presence of coastal facilities (aquaculture, marine laboratories) among potential
  vectors, we evaluated a mandated biosecurity protocol, namely, seawater treated
  with bleach at 50 ppm (50 mg l-1) free chlorine for ≥2 h and measured using test
  strips, for lethality against G. turuturu and several native algae. We report unexpected
  resilience to bleach-treatment (Mastocarpus textgreater Grateloupia textgreater
  Palmaria). Holdfasts of G. turuturu and Mastocarpus stellatus survived 50 and 1000
  ppm free chlorine, respectively. Cystocarps on cultured blades of G. turuturu were
  particularly resistant to bleach-treatment; they produced outgrowths on fragmenting
  blades that became fertile tetrasporophytes in culture, suggesting reproductive
  adaptations of cystocarps to stressful conditions that may have broader evolutionary
  significance. Juvenile, microscopic crusts of G. turuturu were also bleach-resistant
  if covered by diatoms, and developed upright axes. Free chlorine test strips were
  inaccurate in seawater, and their use could increase the risk of failed biosecurity
  as a vector for invasion. Because chlorination at economic and environmentally safe
  levels is insufficient, we recommend a combination of treatments for comprehensive
  biosecurity.
