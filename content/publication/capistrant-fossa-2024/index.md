abstract: As global declines in seagrass populations continue to cause great concern,
  long-term assessment of seagrass meadows show promise in furnishing valuable clues
  into fundamental causes of seagrass loss and drivers of environmental change. Here
  we report two long-term records of seagrass presence in western Gulf of Mexico coastal
  waters (Laguna Madre) that provided insight into their rapid decline in a relatively
  pristine ecosystem. Coincident with unprecedented increases in water depth starting
  in 2014 (14--25þinspacemmþinspacey−1), monthly measurements at a deep edge fixed
  station revealed that two ubiquitous seagrass species (Halodule wrightii and Syringodium
  filiforme) vanished altogether in just five years; a subsequent basin-wide assessment
  revealed that seagrasses disappeared at 23% of 144 sentinel stations. Models that
  incorporate differing sea level rise scenarios and water depth thresholds reveal
  potential global losses of seagrass habitat (14,000þinspacekm2), with expansion
  into newly created shallow habitats constrained by altered natural shorelines.
