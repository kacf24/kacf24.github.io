abstract: ABSTRACT Latitudinal diversity gradients have provided many insights into
  species differentiation and community processes. In the well-studied intertidal
  zone, however, little is known about latitudinal diversity in microbiomes associated
  with habitat-forming hosts. We investigated microbiomes of Fucus vesiculosus because
  of deep understanding of this model system and its latitudinally large, cross-Atlantic
  range. Given multiple effects of photoperiod, we predicted that cross-Atlantic microbiomes
  of the Fucus microbiome would be similar at similar latitudes and correlate with
  environmental factors. We found that community structure and individual amplicon
  sequencing variants (ASVs) showed distinctive latitudinal distributions, but alpha
  diversity did not. Latitudinal differentiation was mostly driven by ASVs that were
  more abundant in cold temperate to subarctic (e.g., Granulosicoccus_t3260, BurkholderiaCaballeroniaParaburkholderia_t8371)
  or warm temperate (Pleurocapsa_t10392) latitudes. Their latitudinal distributions
  correlated with different humidity, tidal heights, and air/sea temperatures, but
  rarely with irradiance or photoperiod. Many ASVs in potentially symbiotic genera
  displayed novel phylogenetic biodiversity with differential distributions among
  tissues and regions, including closely related ASVs with differing north-south distributions
  that correlated with Fucus phylogeography. An apparent southern range contraction
  of F. vesiculosus in the NW Atlantic on the North Carolina coast mimics that recently
  observed in the NE Atlantic. We suggest cross-Atlantic microbial structure of F.
  vesiculosus is related to a combination of past (glacial-cycle) and contemporary
  environmental drivers.
