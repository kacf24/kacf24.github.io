abstract = {ABSTRACT Latitudinal diversity gradients have provided many insights into species differentiation and community processes. In the well-studied intertidal zone, however, little is known about latitudinal diversity in microbiomes associated with habitat-forming hosts. We investigated microbiomes of Fucus vesiculosus because of deep understanding of this model system and its latitudinally large, cross-Atlantic range. Given multiple effects of photoperiod, we predicted that cross-Atlantic microbiomes of the Fucus microbiome would be similar at similar latitudes and correlate with environmental factors. We found that community structure and individual amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs) showed distinctive latitudinal distributions, but alpha diversity did not. Latitudinal differentiation was mostly driven by ASVs that were more abundant in cold temperate to subarctic (e.g., Granulosicoccus\_t3260, BurkholderiaCaballeroniaParaburkholderia\_t8371) or warm temperate (Pleurocapsa\_t10392) latitudes. Their latitudinal distributions correlated with different humidity, tidal heights, and air/sea temperatures, but rarely with irradiance or photoperiod. Many ASVs in potentially symbiotic genera displayed novel phylogenetic biodiversity with differential distributions among tissues and regions, including closely related ASVs with differing north-south distributions that correlated with Fucus phylogeography. An apparent southern range contraction of F. vesiculosus in the NW Atlantic on the North Carolina coast mimics that recently observed in the NE Atlantic. We suggest cross-Atlantic microbial structure of F. vesiculosus is related to a combination of past (glacial-cycle) and contemporary environmental drivers.}

@article{Bricknell2020,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020 The Authors. Reviews in Aquaculture published by John Wiley {\&} Sons Australia, Ltd Climate change is one of the biggest challenges facing development and continuation of sustainable aquaculture in temperate regions. We primarily consider the ecological and physical resilience of aquaculture in the Gulf of Maine (GoM), where a thriving industry includes marine algae, extensive and intensive shellfish aquaculture, and a well-established Atlantic salmon industry, as well as the infrastructure required to support these economically important ventures. The historical record of sea surface temperature in the GoM, estimated from gridded, interpolated in situ measurements, shows considerable interannual and decade-scale variability superimposed on an overall warming trend. Climate model projections of sea surface temperature indicate that the surface waters in the GoM could warm 0.5–3.5°C beyond recent values by the year 2100. This suggests that, while variability will continue, anomalous warmth of marine heatwaves that have been observed in the past decade could become the norm in the GoM ca. 2050, but with the most significant impacts to existing aquaculture along the southernmost region of the coast. We consider adaptations leading to aquacultural resilience despite the effects of warming, larger numbers of harmful nonindigenous species (including pathogens and parasites), acidification, sea-level rise, and more frequent storms and storm surges. Some new species will be needed, but immediate attention to adapt existing species (e.g. preserve/define wild biodiversity, breed for temperature tolerance and incorporate greater husbandry) and aquaculture infrastructure can be successful. We predict that these measures and continued collaboration between industry, stakeholders, government and researchers will lead to sustaining a vibrant working waterfront in the GoM.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019. A non-indigenous alga, Grateloupia turuturu (Halymeniales, Rhodophyta), was discovered in the Damariscotta Estuary (Maine, USA) in 2017, over 200 km north of its last reported location. Because of the presence of coastal facilities (aquaculture, marine laboratories) among potential vectors, we evaluated a mandated biosecurity protocol, namely, seawater treated with bleach at 50 ppm (50 mg l-1) free chlorine for ≥2 h and measured using test strips, for lethality against G. turuturu and several native algae. We report unexpected resilience to bleach-treatment (Mastocarpus {\textgreater} Grateloupia {\textgreater} Palmaria). Holdfasts of G. turuturu and Mastocarpus stellatus survived 50 and 1000 ppm free chlorine, respectively. Cystocarps on cultured blades of G. turuturu were particularly resistant to bleach-treatment; they produced outgrowths on fragmenting blades that became fertile tetrasporophytes in culture, suggesting reproductive adaptations of cystocarps to stressful conditions that may have broader evolutionary significance. Juvenile, microscopic crusts of G. turuturu were also bleach-resistant if covered by diatoms, and developed upright axes. Free chlorine test strips were inaccurate in seawater, and their use could increase the risk of failed biosecurity as a vector for invasion. Because chlorination at economic and environmentally safe levels is insufficient, we recommend a combination of treatments for comprehensive biosecurity.},

abstract={As global declines in seagrass populations continue to cause great concern, long-term assessment of seagrass meadows show promise in furnishing valuable clues into fundamental causes of seagrass loss and drivers of environmental change. Here we report two long-term records of seagrass presence in western Gulf of Mexico coastal waters (Laguna Madre) that provided insight into their rapid decline in a relatively pristine ecosystem. Coincident with unprecedented increases in water depth starting in 2014 (14--25{\thinspace}mm{\thinspace}y−1), monthly measurements at a deep edge fixed station revealed that two ubiquitous seagrass species (Halodule wrightii and Syringodium filiforme) vanished altogether in just five years; a subsequent basin-wide assessment revealed that seagrasses disappeared at 23{\%} of 144 sentinel stations. Models that incorporate differing sea level rise scenarios and water depth thresholds reveal potential global losses of seagrass habitat (14,000{\thinspace}km2), with expansion into newly created shallow habitats constrained by altered natural shorelines.},
